**Tcpdump** is a command-line utility that allows you to capture and analyze network traffic going through your system. It is often used to help troubleshoot network issues, as well as a security tool. Since it's command-line driven, it's ideal to use run in remote servers or devices where access to a GUI is not available.

```bash
# --list-interfaces
tcpdump -D
```
